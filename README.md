# MyAptitude - Online aptitude exam generation system using web scraping

## Abstract:  
People prefer shortcuts in today's fast-paced world—the quickest, fastest, easiest, least effort path paradigm. As a result, companies may find it challenging to come up with different sets of aptitude questions when testing candidates for different job profiles. Additionally, most students and fresh graduates struggle to pass aptitude exams these days. One of the most crucial components of all competitive tests, entrance exams, and campus interviews for government and IT employment is the online aptitude test. Thus, for new students joining the engineering field, practising consistently and improving their aptitude skills becomes crucial. Tests of aptitude rate a person's cognitive ability and are used to measure general intelligence. This test consists of multiple subtests that assess a person's ability to reason, solve problems mathematically, and pay attention to details. Standardized aptitude tests have been incorporated into the hiring process over time and have proved essential in upholding meritocracy in the technical sector. In today's competitive job market, aptitude tests have become vital for job seekers, and it is therefore crucial to consider them carefully when preparing for and applying for positions. Therefore, we developed an Online Aptitude Exam Generation System in which question papers would be generated in real-time and students could practice aptitude questions to gain an idea of what is needed in the modern era to succeed in various companies' aptitude rounds. This would reduce the headache of various companies having to arrange or set different sets of question papers and also give students a platform where they can brush up on their aptitude skills.

## Implementation Details:

### 1.	Methodology and Algorithms:
The methodology for developing the Online Aptitude Exam Generation System follows a systematic approach, incorporating various stages from data collection to system implementation. It ensures the seamless integration of web scraping techniques for data collection, along with provisions for client-provided data in CSV format.

### 2.	Data Collection:
Data collection is a crucial phase in building the system's question bank and informing the question generation algorithm. It involves: 
•	Web Scraping: Utilizing web scraping techniques to extract aptitude questions from online resources, educational websites, and question banks. This automated process involves parsing HTML pages, extracting relevant text and metadata, and storing the data in a structured format.
•	Client-Provided Data: Providing clients with the option to upload their question data in CSV format. This allows for customization and integration of proprietary question banks or specific question sets tailored to the client's requirements.

### 3.	Algorithm Design: 
The algorithms for the Online Aptitude Exam Generation System are meticulously crafted to handle diverse website structures for efficient data extraction and question selection. The web scraping algorithm, tailored for each website, ensures adaptability to varying layouts and structures, facilitating comprehensive data collection. BeautifulSoup: A Python library designed for web scraping tasks, particularly for parsing HTML and XML documents. It provides convenient methods and structures for navigating, searching, and manipulating the parsed data.
