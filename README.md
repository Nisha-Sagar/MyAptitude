# MyAptitude - ONLINE APTITUDE EXAM GENERATION SYSTEM USING WEB SCRAPING

In today's fast-paced world, where efficiency is key, creating diverse sets of aptitude questions can be challenging for companies conducting employee rounds. Students and freshers face difficulties in clearing crucial aptitude tests for competitive exams and job interviews. To address this, we're developing an Online Aptitude Exam Generation System. The MyAptitude will provide real-time generation of aptitude question papers, helping students practice and excel in the competitive job market.

### Drawbacks of Current System Architecture
The ongoing debate between digital and paper-based information storage highlights the limitations of the existing system. Storing information on hard-copy papers presents several challenges:
Limited Space: Finding adequate space for the continuously generated paper documents becomes problematic, given their importance.
Tedious Filing: Categorizing and filing documents manually is time-consuming and tedious.
Difficulty in Filtering: Managing a large number of documents makes it challenging to filter relevant ones from irrelevant ones.
Time-Consuming Review Process: Manual processes at centres and paper-based record-keeping make reviewing records a time-consuming task.
Excessive Manual Work: In the current system, teachers must enter questions manually, demanding significant effort and time. This manual entry process is both labour-intensive and time-consuming.

### Proposed System Architecture
To enhance domain outcomes, we propose an innovative mechanism enabling exam authorities to conduct online aptitude exams using web scraping. The system includes modules such as paper creation, online paper assessment, and web scraping for question selection based on aptitude types or levels. 
The proposed system ensures minimal human intervention, relying on machines to fetch real-time questions from various websites, create an automated dataset, and generate exam papers. The questions fetched are stored in a customized dataset, and exam authorities can choose the paper patternâ€”number of questions and minimum passing marks. Candidates receive instant results upon completing the exam, determining their pass or fail status. For organizations wishing to use their dataset, an upload module allows them to seamlessly integrate their CSV file, ensuring questions are fetched and utilized from their specific dataset.

Imagine being part of a project team working towards creating an online platform for real-time generation of aptitude exams. Our approach involves moving away from static question sets and adopting a dynamic system that fetches questions as needed, utilizing web scraping from various sources. This not only keeps the exams current but also minimizes the risk of question paper leaks, a critical concern in education. This innovative system aims to alleviate the manual workload of examiners who spend considerable time creating question sets. By automating the process, the platform efficiently generates diverse and relevant questions, enhancing exam quality and allowing educators to redirect their focus to other essential tasks.
